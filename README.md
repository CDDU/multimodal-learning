## Semi-Supervised Multimodal Learning with Generative Models

This repository contains code for my [master's thesis](). See [here](https://github.com/punit-haria/multimodal-learning/tree/master/code/models) for model and network definitions. The scripts [here](https://github.com/punit-haria/multimodal-learning/tree/master/code) are for running experiments and plotting results.
