## Semi-Supervised Multimodal Learning with Generative Models

This repository contains code for my [master's thesis](https://github.com/punit-haria/multimodal-learning/blob/master/thesis/punit-shah-thesis.pdf). See [here](https://github.com/punit-haria/multimodal-learning/tree/master/code/models) for model and network specifications. The scripts [here](https://github.com/punit-haria/multimodal-learning/tree/master/code) are for reading data, running experiments, and plotting results.
